0x0C. C - More malloc, free

Tasks
0. Trust no one
mandatory
Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.

Prototype: void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b);
Returns a pointer to the allocated memory
if malloc fails, the malloc_checked function should cause normal process termination with a status value of 98

5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope
#advanced
Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.

Usage: mul num1 num2
num1 and num2 will be passed in base 10
Print the result, followed by a new line
If the number of arguments is incorrect, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of 98
num1 and num2 should only be composed of digits. If not, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of 98
You are allowed to use more than 5 functions in your file
You can use bc (man bc) to check your results.
